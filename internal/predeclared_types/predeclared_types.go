// idiom.

// Creating package scoped variables is typically a bad idea.  Introducing
// global state creates hard to track down defects and also makes code
// typically harder to test, be explicit and provide the necessary dependencies

// Some things may be ok in a global setting, such as a global logger instance
// however other state and variable specifics that may be written too is bad

// slices, maps, arrays and structs are NOT immutable and there is no way
// to even declare an immutable field/attribute type on a struct.

// constants like literals, can be typed or untyped.  There are good use cases
// for both.  We will cover untyped here for now and one of the main benefits
// is the increased flexibility.  Consider the scenario where you may want
