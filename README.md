# learning-go-book

Learning materials and exercises from the `learning-go` 2nd edition book.
The book can be purchased/found Here: [https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-go-2nd/9781098139285/](Here).

It is currently the best `go` resource I have personally used, would highly recommend it.
